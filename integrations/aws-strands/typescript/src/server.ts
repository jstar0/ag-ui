   * Cross-origin access policy. Omit it and no CORS middleware is installed at
   * all: the app answers with no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, so a
   * browser refuses to hand any cross-origin response to the calling page.
   * Cross-origin access is opt-in because the agent route is unauthenticated
   * by default, and an allowed origin can invoke the agent, trigger whatever
   * side effects its tools have, and read the streamed response back.
   *
   * Pass a value to opt in. Any value that installs the middleware also loads
   * the optional `cors` peer dependency, so it has to be installed:
   * - `false` or `""`: same as omitting the option, no middleware and no CORS
   *   response headers.
   * - `"*"`: emitted verbatim as `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, which is
   *   convenient for local development.
   * - a single origin string: a fixed origin, not an allowlist. `cors` emits it
   *   verbatim to every caller, whichever origin asked, without ever comparing
   *   the request's `Origin` against it.
   * - an array of origins: the exact-match form. The request's `Origin` has to
   *   equal an entry, and a miss withholds `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`. `[]`
   *   denies every origin, yet still installs the middleware, so preflights
   *   are answered with `204` and the default permissive method list while
   *   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` is withheld. A `"*"` inside an array is a
   *   literal one-character origin string that no browser origin equals, so
   *   `["*"]` denies everything: only the bare string `"*"` is the wildcard.
   * - `true`: reflects the request's `Origin` header back per-request, a more
   *   permissive posture than `"*"`.
   *
   * Whichever value installs the middleware, it is installed with
   * `credentials: true` and there is no option to change that, so every
   * response the middleware acts on carries
   * `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`. Two consequences worth reading
   * before picking a value:
   * - `true` is the value to be careful with, not `"*"`. A reflected origin
   *   paired with that credentials header is a pair browsers honour for a
   *   credentialed request, so `true` lets a page on any origin make a
   *   credentialed call to the agent route and read the stream back. On a route
   *   with no {@link CreateStrandsAppOptions.auth} guard that is every site the
   *   browser visits. Prefer an exact-match array.
   * - `"*"` fails in the safer direction. The CORS protocol tells browsers to
   *   reject a literal wildcard combined with credentials, so `"*"` only ever
   *   serves requests that send no credentials and cannot carry cookies. Name
   *   the origins explicitly when the browser has to send them.
