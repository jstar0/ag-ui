# adapter's own bookkeeping (idempotency fingerprint + AG-UI-specific
# interrupt metadata like responseSchema/expiresAt) layered on top of
# Strands' native ``_interrupt_state``. Strands' own SessionManager already
# persists/restores ``_interrupt_state`` (and, on a fresh process, the
# per-thread agent + session are reconstructed before this bookkeeping is
# consulted — see the resume-validation gate in ``run()``), but this
# adapter-only bookkeeping lived purely in a Python dict on the
# ``StrandsAgent`` instance, so a process restart lost it: rules 6/7
# (payload-schema validation, expiresAt enforcement) would silently degrade,
# and a replayed resume request would no longer be recognized as a duplicate
# and could re-invoke the model/tool.
#
# To survive a restart, this bookkeeping is now mirrored into
# ``strands_agent.state`` under a single namespaced key — the same
# per-thread, SessionManager-persisted key-value store the adapter already
# uses for ``agui_context``. On every read, if nothing is cached in-process
# for this thread_id, fall back to what's persisted in state.
