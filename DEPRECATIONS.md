# Deprecations

The shims the SDKs still carry for peers speaking a pre-1.0 protocol. Each
entry names what was retired, what replaces it, where the shim lives, and
when the shim itself expires — twelve months after it shipped, following the
project's shim window. After the expiry date the shim may be removed in the
next release, and the deprecated shape stops working entirely.

The 1.0 contract (spec/draft/schema.json) does not describe any of these
shapes. They exist only as conversions in the client middleware layer: the
always-on inbound boundary (`CompatibilityBoundary`) upgrades what arrives,
and the version-gated `BackwardCompatibility_0_0_39`/`_0_0_47` middlewares
downgrade or upgrade what is sent. Every inbound conversion warns; outbound,
the warnings fire where a conversion loses or strands content (the
non-lossy binary upgrade for a modern peer is silent).
`SUPPRESS_TRANSFORMATION_WARNINGS=true` silences the warnings, not the
conversions.

| Deprecated shape | Replacement | Shim | Expires |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `THINKING_START` event | `REASONING_START` | inbound boundary (and `BackwardCompatibility_0_0_45` for gated flows) | 2027-08-24 |
| `THINKING_END` event | `REASONING_END` | inbound boundary (and `BackwardCompatibility_0_0_45`) | 2027-08-24 |
| `THINKING_TEXT_MESSAGE_START` event | `REASONING_MESSAGE_START` | inbound boundary (and `BackwardCompatibility_0_0_45`) | 2027-08-24 |
| `THINKING_TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT` event | `REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT` | inbound boundary (and `BackwardCompatibility_0_0_45`) | 2027-08-24 |
| `THINKING_TEXT_MESSAGE_END` event | `REASONING_MESSAGE_END` | inbound boundary (and `BackwardCompatibility_0_0_45`) | 2027-08-24 |
| `{ type: "binary" }` input content part | the media parts (`image`, `audio`, `video`, `document`) with a `source` | inbound boundary; outbound `BackwardCompatibility_0_0_47` | 2027-08-24 |
| `parentMessageId: null` on `TOOL_CALL_START` | omit the field | inbound boundary | 2027-08-24 |
| `parentMessageId: null` on `TOOL_CALL_CHUNK` | omit the field | inbound boundary | 2027-08-24 |
| `outcome: null` on `RUN_FINISHED` | omit the field | inbound boundary | 2027-08-24 |

A `null` **value under a metadata key** is not on this list and never will
be: metadata is open by key and a null value there is data. Only a `null` in
place of a whole optional field was ever a deviation.
